## How it works

Nowadays we are working hard everyday to make the Internet a more **creative** place. We have a countless number of technologies, techniques and as many tools to do so. Today, I would like to present you the next one you will use.

The default behavior of your browser reloading the page everytime you click a link has been deprecated since a few years. Thanks to Ajax techniques we can now create awesome transitions between our pages, offering our users a better and more immersive experience.

Highway is a lightweight (**1.8kb** *minified and gzipped*), dependency-free, complete and easy-to-use **Router** written in **ES6**. It will never be so easy to add transitions to your websites. The only limit is **your imagination**.

Everytime a user will click a link, the requested page will be loaded in **Ajax** with the **Fetch API**. This will give you the ability to add transitions between the current page and the requested one.
